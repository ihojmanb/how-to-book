# Ho-To Book

January, 2021

This is my personal guide to every command I find useful but can't quite remember it.

I wanted to have a straight-forward way to get to the console commands I use the most,
without having to go to some site with ads and unnecesary text walls. 

I intend to update this constantly. For now, it's for personal use but I would love to
have a place where other people search for commands with easyness,
and get a clear answer to what they are looking for. So contributions
are very welcome! If you have any design guidelines to structure de project and,
more importantly, commands you want to include on this list, feel free to
make a Pull Request.

TODO:
* Polish existent md files
